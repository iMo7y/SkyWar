## Description

**SkyWar** is an exciting game where you take control of a jet and engage with three different types of enemies:

1. **Enemy Jet**: This adversary has 5 lives, meaning you must shoot it 5 times to destroy it. Each destruction earns you 10 score points.

2. **Helicopter**: With 8 lives, taking down a helicopter will reward you with 15 score points.

3. **Lucky Bird**: This unique enemy has only 1 life and grants you 1 score point upon elimination. However, colliding with the Lucky Bird will activate Power Mode.

**Power Mode** enhances your gameplay by providing:

- 10 seconds of rapid ammo loading.
- Unlocking a new projectile that deals 5 times the damage and travels at 2 times the speed of the regular projectile. 

**Important**: Do not eliminate the Lucky Bird if you want to experience Power Mode! It is the only enemy you can collide with without losing points.

## How to Play

Playing **SkyWar** is straightforward:

- Use the **Up Arrow key** to ascend.
- Use the **Down Arrow key** to descend.

## Gameplay

In **SkyWar**, you have 60 seconds to achieve a score of 200 points. Failing to reach this target will result in a game over. Remember to collide with the Lucky Bird to unlock a powerful feature. Avoid colliding with other enemies, as it will deduct score points from your total.
